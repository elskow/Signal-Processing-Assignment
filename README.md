# Signal Processing

This repository is created as a part of the assignments for the Signal Processing course in the Data Science program. This code is a practical implementation of signal processing and FFT transformation for signal data analysis. The code consists of several tasks that provide a different understanding of how signal processing techniques can be applied in signal data processing. The tasks include:

1. Change the signal data into .wav format and write it to the output file.
2. Input the signal data for FFT transformation.
3. Plot the signal data and the result of the FFT transformation.
4. Add noise to the signal data.
5. Input the signal data with noise for FFT transformation.
6. Plot the signal data with noise and the result of the FFT transformation with noise.

The code uses the soundfile, numpy, and matplotlib libraries to make it easier to process signal data and visualize the results in a plot.

Overall, this practical provides a good foundation for researchers or practitioners to develop further signal processing techniques and apply them in various applications such as audio processing, image processing, or data processing.
